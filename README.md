## FPGABoy

FPGABoy is a Chisel3 implementation of the Game Boy and NES audio processing units (APUs) as a final project for CSE 228A at UCSC. Game Boy support is currently complete, while NES support is in progress. Audio is output over HDMI and aux on the Nexys Video board. For style points, this project implements video rendering as well. The first slide displays a screenshot from the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game for Game Boy Color. The following pages (use the left/right buttons) display the slides for the project presentation.

### Testing

Tests are currently incomplete. The only working test that does any useful verification is `DividerTests`. `GameBoyTests` and `NESTests` run for a *very* long time (multiple hours) and produce VCD outputs for manual inspection. Run `make testDivider` to run `DividerTests`, `make testGB` to run `GameBoyTests` or `make testNES` to run `NESTests`.

### Building

TODO. I'll probably include a zip of the Vivado project, but it will likely include absolute paths that will have to be fixed manually. I'll also include instructions on how to set up the project from scratch.

### Bitstreams

Sample Nexys Video bitstreams from various stages in the project are available in the `bits` directory. `trippy3.bit` and `mario12.bit` are good demos (press the center button to start the music), while `loudnoise.bit` is *definitely* not.
